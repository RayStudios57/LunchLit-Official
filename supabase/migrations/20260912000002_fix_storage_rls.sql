-- Fix: avatars storage bucket + RLS policies for profile picture uploads

-- 1. Create the avatars bucket if it doesn't exist (public so images are viewable)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  5242880,
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  public = true,
  file_size_limit = 5242880,
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif'];

-- 2. Drop any old avatar storage policies to recreate cleanly
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload avatars" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view avatars" ON storage.objects;

-- 3. Public read access for all avatar files
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- 4. Authenticated users can upload to their own folder ({user_id}/...)
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars'
    AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- 5. Authenticated users can update/replace their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars'
    AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- 6. Authenticated users can delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars'
    AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );
